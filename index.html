  <h2> About Me </h2>

  <p> I am a second year undergraduate student at the Univeristy of Toronto
    where I am pursuing a double major in computer science and statistics.
    I also have a strong passion for math. I hope to be able to work in a field
    that ties all of these subjects together whether in research or in industry.
    Currently I enjoy exploring topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
    In my spare time I am an avid debater and I enjoy playing all racquet
    sports, especially tennis!
